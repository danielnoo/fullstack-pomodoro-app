# fullstack-pomodoro-app

I created this app before I knew anything about anything, please don't judge the code too hard and sorry if it makes your eyes and brain bleed.


NODE/EXPRESS/MONGODB

A full stack pomodoro app that allows users time their work and break periods to optimize their brain power!

Items of focus can be entered as input and when the work period is over a badge is earned and stored in the database and display on the user's stats page.
